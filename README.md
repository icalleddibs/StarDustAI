# StarDustAI

Repository for the course project of **ECE324: Machine Intelligence, Software, and Neural Networks**, a third year Engineering Science course at the University of Toronto taken in 2025 as part of the Machine Intelligence major.

## Overview
The goal of StarDustAI is to utilize SDSS (eBOSS) data to correctly classify galaxies based on spectral and redshift data using a CNN.

### Current Progress
- Started data exploration
    - Understanding eBOSS experiments and the science behind spectroscopy measurements
    - Selecting variables to utilize
- Started data preprocessing
